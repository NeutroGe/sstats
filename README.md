# Summoner's stats
A Windows app that automatically retrieves stats for League of Legends ranked solo/duo queue games.

These are the same stats you can get from websites like op.gg or leagueofgraphs.com but it's automatically displayed on your screen when you start a game, and the stats displayed are always up to date.

There are others apps available that try to do the same thing like blitz.gg but they are very complicated, very heavy (over 100MB), require you to install them on your computer, create an account, and most of the time the displayed stats are incorrect.

Here is a short demo of the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z6y6mL0W08
