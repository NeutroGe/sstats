# Summoner's stats
A Windows app that automatically retrieves stats for League of Legends ranked solo/duo queue games.

These are the same stats you can get from websites like op.gg or leagueofgraphs.com but it's automatically displayed on your screen when you start a game, and the stats displayed are always up to date.

There are others apps available that try to do the same thing like blitz.gg but they are very complicated, very heavy (over 100MB), require you to install them on your computer, create an account, and most of the time the displayed stats are incorrect.

Here is a short demo of the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z6y6mL0W08

## How to use

### Get your riot development api key

1. Go to https://developer.riotgames.com/
2. Login with any league of legends account
3. Click on (re)generate API key
4. Copy your API key (it should be something like RGAPI-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx) and save it somewhere.

### Download the app zip file and extract it on your computer

It can be downloaded here

Once done paste your riot api key inside the file "api_key.txt", start the league client, start summoner's stats, you're good to go!
